- **Objects**

- Should probably keep notes of my progress. Something to look back on for help or to be able to see my progress.
- Working on JavaScript Objects.
- Now I understand a lot better the basics of objects.

- **Functions**
- **Conditional Statements**

  - `if(condition) { statement a; }`
  - When you start the program. It'll will get to the condition and if it is true. The program will run. If false then it'll just exit

  - `else(condition) {statement b;}`
  - With `else`, if the initial condition is not met. Then the code will move down to the next line and run that code.

  - && = and. This means that both of the conditions need to be met for the outcome to be true. Otherwise it'll be false.

  - || = or. This means that one of the conditions need to be met in order for the outcome to be true.
