- **Objects**

- Should probably keep notes of my progress. Something to look back on for help or to be able to see my progress.
- Working on JavaScript Objects.
- Now I understand a lot better the basics of objects.

- **Functions**
- **Conditional Statements**

  - `if(condition) { statement a; }`
  - When you start the program. It'll will get to the condition and if it is true. The program will run. If false then it'll just exit

  - `else(condition) {statement b;}`
  - With `else`, if the initial condition is not met. Then the code will move down to the next line and run that code.

  - && = and. This means that both of the conditions need to be met for the outcome to be true. Otherwise it'll be false.

  - || = or. This means that one of the conditions need to be met in order for the outcome to be true.

**Loops**

- Loops are used to repeat a specific block until some end condition is met
- Used to run over the same code over and over. But each time with a different value

- _while loop_ - While the condition is TRUE, the code within the loop is executed
- `while(condition) { loop code;}`

- _Do while loop_ - This loop will first execute the code, then check the condition and while the condition holds true, execute repeatedly
- `do { loop code;} while(condition);`

- _For Loop_ - Repeatedly executes the loop code while a given condition is TRUE. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.
- `for(begin; condition; step) {loop code;}`
